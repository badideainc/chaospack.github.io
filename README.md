# Chaos-Pack
The goofy minecraft bedrock behavior pack I made. As the name implies the mod includes a lot of random stuff.

This code can be used for guidance with creating your own packs.

*NOTE* Some of the javascript code was created with the assistance of Perplexity AI. This is due to alot of bedrock API being unclear and my unfamiliarity with javascript (AI is not used anywhere during the modelling, texturing or idea generation process)
